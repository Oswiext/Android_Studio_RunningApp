# Android_Studio_RunningApp

This app is connected to firebase and has an activity where you login with google authentication in loginactivity and your information is going to be saved in firebase. 
The mainactivity has a google maps fragment that ask permission where you are and with gps auto zoom into you on start and track you with a position on the map. The Application also has a timer in milliseconds that you can start and pause to get the information on how long it takes you to get from point A to B. You can logout in menu in mainactivity. 
A few changes were made, it used to have a layout bar with activity fragments, but it was not optimal for the applications purpose. there is also a menu item in mainactivity for logout.
